## Name Sake, Hiram Conibear
    Hiram Conibear was born in 1871 and lived until 1917. He was a foundational coach for the University of Washington's Rowing program. His unique style of rowing that he tought impacted the sport nationaly and globaly for years after it's intoduction. He brought a Varsity crew to the Intercollegiate Rowing Association regatta for the first time in UW's history in 1913. Today, over 100 years later Washington has one of the best records for winning National Championships at the IRA regatta.

### George Pocock
    An early founder of Washington's rowing ability and character was an english boatbuilder named **George Yeoman Pocock**. He was hired by Hiram Conibear to build new and lighter racing shells for the University in the early 1910s and worked at the UW Shellhouse making boats until the late 1960s. A combination of his technical boatbuilding skills learned under his father in Eaton, England and the local materials, cedar and pine, led to Pocock racing shells to be regarded as some of the highest quality and fastest shells one could buy. Starting in the 1920s Washington crews rowing Pocock shells began returning from the IRAs with National Championship titles, a tradition that is still being upheld.

## The Boys of 36'
    Duing the 1935-36 season an underdog Varsity crew was formed. These 9 rowers were each born out of the unique hardships created by the great deppression in the decade beforehand. Most came with rather humbel origins, all from small logging, farming, or mining towns scattered across the state of Washington. The crew came together to beat Cal in the annual duel race, win IRAs against the Ivy Leagues to claim another National Title, and eventually qualify for the 1936 Olympics.

    This chance to go the Olympics eventually allowed for a boat full of college kids from the University of Washington to defeat the Germans in the grandfinal of the 1936 Berlin Olympics for the Gold medal in audience of thousands of German people, Adolf Hitler, and Joseph Goebbels. the story of these boys is still extremly important to todays boathouse culture at UW and will continue to be for the forseable future
